      Similar to the glutes the hamstrings allow you to pulll back on the ground so you aren't constantly knee driving to run. The hamstrings are necessary to complete your leg cycle so you can step again and keep moving. Typically a hamstring injury means your running needs to come to a halt until you are well. This simple drill will help to prevent injury by stretching your hamstring.

      Stand and balance on one leg. Reach down and attempt to touch your toes with the arm which is opposite to the side with the balancing leg. Reach for the inner part of the toes, then the front of the toes, the across the outer part of the toes. With three reps per cycle do this for three cycles (nine times).
