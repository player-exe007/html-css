    The glute raise and hold engages the glutes by holding them in a raised postion for a period of time. The glutes are essential for pulling back on the ground to propel yourself forward, allowing you to run. If your glutes are injured, tight, etc, your running experience will be degraded and the quality of your workout will be reduced. This drill will prevent injury by warming up your glutes and getting them used to being contracted completely.
