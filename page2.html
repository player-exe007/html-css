      The glute raise and hold engages the glutes by holding them in a raised postion for a period of time. The glutes are essential for pulling back on the ground to propel yourself forward, allowing you to run. If your glutes are injured, tight, etc, your running experience will be degraded and the quality of your workout will be reduced. This drill will prevent injury by warming up your glutes and getting them used to being contracted completely.

      You will begin laying flat on the ground and engage your glutes to raise your hips up in the air. Once your feet are driving into the floor and your hips are in the air, raise one leg to be paralell with the other leg's quad (the one with the foot on the ground still). Hold this for about 15 seconds, then switch legs.
