      The calf is an essential group of muscles. The calf provides movement to your foot, allowing you to run fast and stay stable. Many injuries can occure in the calf wether it be cramping, pulling, a tendon issue, etc. Calf bounces will help to reduce injuries during slow or fast runs.

      This drill simply consists of bouncing on the balls of the feet. You should only be using your calves to do this, and try to keep the foot pulled up while in the air, before extending when making contact with the ground.
