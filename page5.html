      Many injuries can occur within the groin. The groin plays a role in stabilizing the way you leg drives into the ground. For many Track & Field runners running events such as the 100m Dash, 200m Dash, 400m Dash, 800m Dash a groin injury can force you to scratch your race. Even if you're not a Track & Field athlete you will want to make sure your groin is injury free, especially if you do even the long distance races where you still must move quick for the finishing pert of your race.

      To perform this stretch you will begin as you started with the <a href="page1.html">Hip Flexor Stretch</a> (in the L shape). Straighten out one of the legs back and drive your hips into the ground. You should be able to feel a pull in your groin of the side with the leg still forward.
